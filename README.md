# cyclone-tracking

A scalable and end-to-end approach to tropical cyclone tracking using Graph Attention Networks

## Data Loading

- We have successfully loaded the [IBTracs](data/ibtracs.ipynb) dataset, however, it is not in grid form and thus not representable as a graph.
- We found a starting point for working with the [era5](data/era5.ipynb) dataset.
